Treeish
=======

Yet another open copy of HN. Trying to make it really simple.

Goals
-----

- Finish while still on the plane
- Store tree data in redis (but save locally for now b/c no wifi on
  airplane and no redis module lying around. FUUUUHHH!!!!)
- Render tree markup serverside via simple JS functions
- Use node to deliver tree (don't use framework)
